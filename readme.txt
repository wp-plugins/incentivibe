Business owners like yourself are already seeing tremendous results. See what they have to say about Incentivibe:

"Our company, Splashtop, wanted to increase our email subscribers and used Incentivibe as one of our strategies. Our newsletter subscription increased by 80%. I'd definitely use them again, and recommend it for all businesses that are budget conscious." Joanne D., SplashTop - Featured in NY times

"Incentivibe's model was cost-effective, and was very easy to implement and monitor. After seeing a 40% increase in our Facebook Page interaction, and a 25% increase in our blog traffic, we are excited to get started on our next contest." Steph G, Vidyard - Featured in Forbes

"The idea of paying a fraction of the amount for costly giveaway prizes by sharing the cost with others is just sheer brilliance. WizeNation generated a lot of traffic for the period of time the giveaway contest was taking place." Asim S., WizeNation
